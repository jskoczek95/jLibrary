This is simple CRUD app.

Landing page is login page. You can either register a new user or login with admin credentials:
<li><i>email</i> : admin@admin.pl</li>
<li><i>password</i> : secretadminpass</li>

If you choose to register a new user, you will be asked to fill all the fields. If there's already user with your email, you will be informed. The email has to be unique for every user.
Once logged in you'll see every registered user. As a common user you can:
<li><b>Add</b> a new book to your collection</li>
<li><b>Show</b> the books you own</li>
<li><b>Update</b> your first and last name & update information about your book</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> your account or the particular book you choose</li> </br>
When logged in as common user, if you delete your account you'll automaticaly get redirected to login page.
If you choose to log in as an <b>admin</b> (besides basic operations) you'll be able to delete other users or update their basic data. However, because you're admin you cannot delete your own account ;)

Enjoy!
