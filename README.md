This is a simple CRM app.
First step is to register using link - /user/register. When you do so you can sign in to the app.
The landing page after signing in is user's list. It shows you every created user (user with id=1 is pre-defined admin user,
use the credentials given on the page after registration process). Common user can:
<li><b>add</b> a new book</li>
<li><b>update</b> his first and last name & his book details</li>
<li><b>delete</b> his account & any of his book</li>
and look into other user's book collection. Admin can delete other users, update them and also has the common user's privileges. However, he can't delete his own account. When common user deletes his account, he is redirected to registration page.
Layout is gonna be the last thing to fix. I prefer to focus on the backend logic.

The app is updated in free time, following updates are listed in the <b>"Issues"</b>.
This app was created just for educational purpose. It has no "business background".
